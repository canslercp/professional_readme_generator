# README Generator 

  ## Description
 The README Generator program creates a README with the user's answers to the following questions:
 * What is your GitHub username? 
 * What is your email address? 
 * What is your project's name?  
 * Please write a short description of your project 
 * What kind of license should your project have? 
 * What command should be run to install dependencies? 
 * What command should be run to run tests? 
 * What does the user need to know about using the repo? 
 * What does the user need to know about contributing to the repo? 

 The questions are prompted to the user in the terminal. The user's responses are then stored and compiled into a standard README file format with a functioning table of contents, corressponding license badge, and more (see photos and video).
